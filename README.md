# Overview

The **Personal Finance Tracker** is a Python-based application designed to help users manage their income and expenses efficiently. This project demonstrates my ability to work with **Python** and a little bit with **SQLite** to create a data-driven finance tracking tool. 

### **Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to:
- Improve my knowledge of **Python's database handling** using SQLite.
- Implement **file handling and transaction tracking** using object-oriented programming principles.

This software allows users to **add and view
** their financial transactions. It also provides **interactive charts** to visualize spending habits, helping users make informed financial decisions.
